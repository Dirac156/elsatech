# Elsa Tech

## Project Setup
Create a new directory (folder) on your computer called “elsatech”. Place HTML, CSS (inside a sub folder named CSS) and Image (inside a sub folder named images) files associated with your new website inside of this directory. The home page of your website should be named “index.html”. Other pages can be named as you like, but should reflect the content of the page. All file and directory names should be limited to letters, numbers, and dashes and be lowercase, with no spaces. You will also create a GitHub repo with a matching name to which you will push the code, and deploy it to Heroku.

## Your Website
At least four HTML web pages including a home page, about us page and, products/services page and a contact us form. The focus of this assignment is on describing web page content with HTML and improving its look and feel using CSS.

Your web site should include both images and text.  There should also be semantic section elements on each page, including but not limited to <main>, <header>, and <footer>.

The pages should link to each other with “relative” URLs. The site should also include at least one “absolute” URL linking to an external website, and opening in a different tab/browser window. Pay close attention to your HTML tags and be sure to test your pages locally in a modern, up-to-date web browser as you code them. You can also check your HTML code using the W3C Markup Validation Service (Links to an external site.).

## Publishing Your Site
Once done with the development, push all your code to your GitHub repository and then deploy your website to Heroku.
